# ML-VAERS-Dataprocessing

The objective of this project was to learn how to preprocess vaccine datasets from the
Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) maintained by CDC. The VAERS
Dataset has data collected about vaccination effects as far as 1990 and includes more than
400,000 reports of adverse events following vaccinations. The data from this dataset is was cleaned and organized to determine which factors affect the adverse effects observed
through association rules.
